title: Requesting Quota Increase
---

Cloud service providers implement quotas to limit the number of virtual machines (VMs) and other resources you can provision within a specific region. These quotas help balance resource allocation and ensure fair usage across all customers. However, when scaling applications or deploying new services, especially those requiring high-end GPUs like V100 or A100, you might encounter quota-related errors, such as QuotaExceeded or VcpuLimitExceeded.

### Tips for Quota Management

<Tip>
  Plan Ahead: Anticipate your resource needs based on upcoming projects or
  scaling plans to request quota increases in advance.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Monitor Usage: Regularly check your current quota usage to avoid unexpected
  service disruptions.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Respond Promptly: Respond to any follow-up inquiries from the support team to
  expedite the approval process and clarify your resource usage plans.

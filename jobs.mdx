# Running Jobs

To run a job, the first thing you need to do is make sure that you have
[created a project config file](./komo-cli-reference/command/init/project) in `.komo/project.yaml`.

There are 2 different ways to launch jobs; either with the `komo run` command or with the `komo do` command.
Both options are described below.

## komo run
You can use the [`komo run`](./komo-cli-reference/command/run) command to start a job.
For example, you could run a python script on your local machine with the following command:

<Note>
This assumes the following:
1. You have a `train.py` script in your project directory.
2. You created a backend named `local`.
</Note>
<Info>
We use `--` to separate args to the CLI from args to your script.
</Info>
```bash
komo run -b local -- python train.py --model llm_small
```

After running that job on your local machine, you might want to then migrate to the cloud so you
can start a much larger multi-node training job. You can do so like this:

<Note>
This assumes the following:
1. You have a `train.py` script in your project directory.
2. You created a backend named `aws`.
3. You created a resource named `gpu-large` for your `aws` backend.
</Note>
```bash
# This will launch a distributed training job across
# 10 machines on your aws backend
komo run -b aws -n 10 -r gpu-large -- python train.py --model llm_large
```

## komo do
As an alternative to the `komo run` command, you can also run a job by
[creating a task file](./komo-cli-reference/command/init/task), and then
executing it using the [`komo do`](./komo-cli-reference/command/do) command
(komo-do...get it?).

For example, if we wanted to run the same 10-node job as above, our task file
would look like this:

```yaml
kind: job

backend: aws
resource: gpu-large

command: [
  "python",
  "train.py",
  "--model",
  "llm_large"
]

num_nodes: 10

# Here is where you can override any of the config variables in the section of your
# project config file corresponding to the backend you're using. For example, if you
# wanted to use a different image, you could do so like this:
# 
# config:
#   image: my_image:latest
# 
# This is the same as the '--config' option in the 'komo run' command.
config: {}
```

And then you could start the job like this:

```bash
komo do -f .komo/my-task-file.yaml
```

# Get the logs for jobs

You can get the logs for a job by running:

```bash
komo logs my-job-id
```

See the [reference](./komo-cli-reference/command/logs) for more information on this command.

# Listing jobs

You can list all of your jobs by simply running:

```bash
komo list
```

See the [reference](./komo-cli-reference/command/list) for more information on this command.

# Describing jobs

You can describe a job to get more information about it, such as the backend job ID
(the ID of the job on whatever backend it is running on), by simply running:

```bash
komo describe my-job-id
```

See the [reference](./komo-cli-reference/command/describe) for more information on this command.

# Start a shell into a job

You can start a shell into a job to help with debugging by running:

```bash
komo shell my-job-id
```

See the [reference](./komo-cli-reference/command/shell) for more information on this command.

# Cancelling jobs

You can cancel a job by running:

```bash
komo cancel my-job-id
```

See the [reference](./komo-cli-reference/command/cancel) for more information on this command.

# Running Jobs

You can use the [`komo run`](./komo-cli-reference/command/run) command to start a job.

For example, you could start a training job with 4 A10G GPUs like so:

<Info>
We use `--` to separate args to the CLI from args to your script.
</Info>
```bash
komo run --cloud aws --gpus A10G:4 -- python train.py --epochs 100
```

### Distributed training

You can scale up jobs across multiple nodes using the `--num-nodes` flag. For distributed jobs,
the following environment variables are set for you to use in your application code:

`NNODES`: The number of nodes launched for the job

`NODE_INDEX`: The index of the current node (between 0 and `NNODES`-1)

`NUM_GPUS`: The number of GPUs on each machine

`NODE_IP_ADDRESSES`: A comma-separated list of IP addresses of all the nodes

`NODE_0_IP_ADDRESS`: The IP address of the master node (same as the first IP address in $NODE_IP_ADDRESSES). Provided for convenience for PyTorch applications

For example, you might use these environment variables with torchrun as follows:

```bash
komo run --cloud aws --gpus A100:8 --num-nodes 4 -- torchrun train.py --nnodes \$NNODES --rdzv-endpoint \$NODE_0_IP_ADDRESS --rdzv-backend c10d --nproc-per-node \$NUM_GPUS train.py --epochs 100
```

Notice that by using these environment variables, you can easily change the value of `--num-nodes` and `--gpus` without needing to update the command you're runnning.

# Get the logs for jobs

You can get the logs for a job by running:

```bash
komo logs my-job-id
```

<Tip>Use the `--follow` flag to wait for new logs as they come in</Tip>

See the [reference](./komo-cli-reference/command/logs) for more information on this command.

# Listing jobs

You can list all of your jobs by simply running:

```bash
komo list
```

See the [reference](./komo-cli-reference/command/list) for more information on this command.

# Describing jobs

You can describe a job to get more information about it, such as the backend job ID
(the ID of the job on whatever backend it is running on), by simply running:

```bash
komo describe my-job-id
```

See the [reference](./komo-cli-reference/command/describe) for more information on this command.

# SSH into a job

You can SSH into a job to help with debugging by running:

```bash
komo ssh my-job-id
```

See the [reference](./komo-cli-reference/command/ssh) for more information on this command.

# Cancelling jobs

You can cancel a job by running:

```bash
komo cancel my-job-id
```

See the [reference](./komo-cli-reference/command/cancel) for more information on this command.

Komodo is a GPU Cloud and developer platform all in one, allowing you to easily launch GPU-backed notebooks, kick off batch jobs, and serve scalable models.

Komodo **abstracts away cloud infrastructure** so that you can focus on your AI development:
* With an easy-to-use CLI, deploy a workflow in minutes, no code changes needed
* Monitor your machines, jobs, and services using our web dashboard
* Open GPU-backed notebooks right from the dashboard
* Serverless job execution means you only pay for the compute you are actively using
* Scalable model serving allows your replicas to scale up and down with traffic (with support for scale-to-zero)

Whether you are just getting started with your development, or are getting ready to productionize your AI models, Komodo supports
you throughout all stages of your development cycle.

Let's [get started](./quickstart)!

Komodo is the AI developer platform for any cloud, allowing you to easily launch GPU-backed notebooks, kick off batch jobs, and serve scalable models.

Simply connect your cloud account(s) and launch a workflow in under 5 minutes. Take advantage of our multi-cloud support to access the **highest GPU availability**
at the **best prices**.

Komodo **abstracts away your cloud infrastructure** so that you can focus on your AI development:
* With an easy-to-use CLI, deploy a workflow in minutes, no code changes needed
* Monitor your machines, jobs, and services using our web dashboard
* Open GPU-backed notebooks right from the dashboard
* Serverless job execution means you only pay for the compute you are actively using
* Scalable model serving allows your replicas to scale up and down with traffic (with support for scale-to-zero)

Whether you are just getting started with your development, or are getting ready to productionize your AI models, Komodo supports
you throughout all stages of your development cycle.

title: Machines

Machines allow you to quickly get access to whatever resources you need for your active development.
Once you start a machine, you can SSH into it, or connect to it through
VSCode, where you can edit files and test out your changes as you please.

<Note>Unlike jobs, you must terminate machines manually once you are finished with them.</Note>

# Starting a machine

You can create a machine on a cloud provider like this:

```bash
# this will create a machine named 'cloud-dev'
komo machine create --cloud aws --gpus T4:1 cloud-dev
```

See the [reference](./komo-cli-reference/command/machine/create) for more information on this command.

# Connecting to a machine

You can ssh into a machine like this:

```bash
komo machine ssh dev
```

You can also open a VSCode window into a machine like this:

```bash
komo machine vscode dev
```

See the [reference](./komo-cli-reference/command/machine/shell) for more information on this command.

# Terminating a machine

Once you are done with a machine, you can terminate it like this:

```bash
komo machine terminate dev
```

See the [reference](./komo-cli-reference/command/machine/terminate) for more information on this command.

Machines are essentially long-running jobs that you can use for active development.
Once you start a machine, you can connect to it either by opening a shell into it, or through
VSCode, where you can edit files and test out your changes as you please.

<Note>Unlike jobs, you must terminate machines manually once you are finished with them.</Note>

# Starting a machine

You can start a machine on your local machine like this:

```bash
# this will create a machine named 'dev'
komo machine create -b local dev
```

Similarly, you can create a machine on a cloud backend like this:

```bash
# this will create a machine named 'cloud-dev'
komo machine create -b aws -r gpu-large cloud-dev
```

See the [reference](./komo-cli-reference/command/machine/create) for more information on this command.

# Connecting to a machine

You can open a shell into a machine like this:

```bash
komo machine shell dev
```

You can also open a VSCode window into a machine like this:

<Info>This feature currently is only supported by the Local backend, but support for other types of backends is coming soon!</Info>

```bash
komo machine vscode dev
```

See the [reference](./komo-cli-reference/command/machine/shell) for more information on this command.

# Terminating a machine

Once you are done with a machine, you can terminate it like this:

```bash
komo machine terminate dev
```

See the [reference](./komo-cli-reference/command/machine/terminate) for more information on this command.

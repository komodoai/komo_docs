        First, make sure you have the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) installed.

        Then, simply just run:

        ```bash
        komo aws connect
        ```
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
  <Step title="(Optional) Initialize a Komodo project in your repository">
    Initialize a new Komodo project by running the following command inside your project directory:
    
    ```bash
    komo init project
    ```
    
    This will create a template project configuration in  `komoproj.yaml`. This lets you set up different
    configuration for your jobs/machines.

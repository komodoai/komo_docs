Komodo AI can run your jobs on various backends. The choice of backend is yours - we strive to provide the same seamless experience regardless of your choice.


<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Komodo CLI">
    Install Komodo CLI from PyPI. If you're not able to use PyPI to install your packages, let us know and we will be happy to provide you with a Python Wheel file.
    ```bash
    pip install komodo-cli
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose and configure compute backend">
    Follow the backend specific instructions
    <Accordion title="Local">
        The Local backend requires no configuration, the sample below can be used as is. However, please make sure you have Docker [installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and running.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Kubernetes">
        You can create a Komodo-compatible Kubernetes cluster using `komo compute create` [command](./komo-cli-reference/command/compute/create)

        If you'd rather bring over an existing Kubernetes cluster, follow the steps below to prepare it for use with Komodo.

        <Tip>
            If you need help with the steps below, reach out to someone on the Platform
            team in your organization or let us know and we'll be happy to work with you
            to get this set up!
        </Tip>

        <Accordion title="Install Volcano" icon="volcano">
            Komodo uses [Volcano](https://volcano.sh/en/) to schedule workloads on your Kubernetes cluster.

            Install Volcano by following the appropriate instructions in the [Volcano README](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano#readme).
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title="Create Komodo Resources" icon="dragon">
            Komodo uses isolated resources to schedule workloads on your cluster. In this section we will configure these resources.

            **Create Komodo Cluster Role**

            ```bash
            kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/komodoai/komo_cli/main/komodo_cli/terraform/komodo_manifests/files/cluster-role.yaml
            ```

            **Create Komodo Service Account**

            ```bash
            kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/komodoai/komo_cli/main/komodo_cli/terraform/komodo_manifests/files/service-account.yaml
            ```

            **Link the Komodo Service Account to the Komodo Cluster Role**

            ```bash
            kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/komodoai/komo_cli/main/komodo_cli/terraform/komodo_manifests/files/cluster-role-binding.yaml
            ```

            **Create a Komodo Service Account Token**

            ```bash
            kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/komodoai/komo_cli/main/komodo_cli/terraform/komodo_manifests/files/service-account-token.yaml
            ```
        </Accordion>
        <Accordion title="Obtain and store cluster details" icon="gear">
            Once you're done [configuring your Kubernetes cluster for use with Komodo](/getting-started#kubernetes), you'll need to obtain the URL of your Kubernetes cluster API server and a token to communicate with the cluster.

            <Note>
            This token belongs to the Service Account we created in the Kubernetes cluster
            configuration step.
            </Note>

            First set the `CLUSTER_NAME` environment variable to the name of your cluster.

            ```bash
            export CLUSTER_NAME="my-cluster-name"
            ```

            ##### **host**

            The value for `host` can be obtained in the following way

            ```bash
            kubectl cluster-info $CLUSTER_NAME | grep "control plane" | awk '{ print $NF }'
            ```

            ##### **bearer_token**

            The value for the `bearer_token` can be obtained using the following steps.

            <Accordion title="How to get cluster name?">
            Try `kubectl config view | grep -m 1 "name" | awk '{ print $2 }'` command or ask your platform engineer.
            </Accordion>

            ```bash
            echo "Obtaining the Service Account token for cluster $CLUSTER_NAME"
            echo ""
            TOKEN=$(kubectl get secret komodo-runner-secret --namespace default -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 -d)
            echo "$TOKEN"
            ```
        </Accordion>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="AWS Batch">
        TODO / No extra setup?
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the Komodo API key">
    The Komodo API key is used to authenticate to the Komodo API. Create an API key by providing your login credentials via the `komo api-key create` command and paste it into the file `~/.komo/api-key` file. [Find more details on this command here.](./komo-cli-reference/command/get-api-key)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create compute backends and resources">
    Run `komo backend create --type <backend-type>` and follow the backend-specific instructions to initialize the backend with Komodo. [Find more details on this command here.](./komo-cli-reference/command/backend/create)

    Run `komo backend add-resource --backend-name <backend-name> --resource-name <resource-name>` to add resources to the backend above. [Find more details on this command here.](./komo-cli-reference/command/backend/add-resource)

    You will reference the backends and resources when launching jobs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize a Komodo project in your repository">
    Initialize a new Komodo project in your repository to run jobs out of it. Run `komo init` wherever you'd like to do that. This will create a `.komo` directory with a template project configuration in the `project.yaml` file for each backend. Edit this file to fit your needs (Required and recommended fields to edit are marked with `TODO:`).

    You can find more information on `komo init` and the project configuration file [here](./komo-cli-reference/command/init).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Your First Komodo Job">
    You are now ready to run your first job! Use the `komo run <options> -- <command>` command to do so. [Find full details on this command here.](./komo-cli-reference/command/run)
  </Step>
</Steps>

Komodo AI can run your jobs on various backends. The choice of backend is yours - we strive to provide the same seamless experience regardless of your choice.


<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Komodo CLI">
    ```bash
    pip install komo
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Register a new account">
    ```bash
    komo register
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the Komodo API key">
    The Komodo API key is used to authenticate to the Komodo API.
    
    ```bash
    komo api-key create
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Setup your backend">
    First, make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed.
    
    Next, follow the instructions for the type of backend you'd like to create:
    <Accordion title="Local">
        Simply just run:

        ```bash
        komo backend create -t local -n local
        ```

        <Note>You can specify whatever name you want using the `-n` flag.</Note>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="AWS">
        Simply just run:

        ```bash
        komo backend create -t aws -n aws
        ```

        This will prompt you to enter the region to create this backend in, along with
        some information about which instance types you want to use.

        <Note>You can specify whatever name you want using the `-n` flag. For example, if you are creating multiple AWS backends in different
        regions, you might name one `aws-us-east-1`. Or if you're only creating one AWS backend, you could just name it `aws`.</Note>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Kubernetes">
        <Note>We don't recommend using Kubernetes if you need support for autoscaling AND multi-node distributed training.
        This is because we use [Volcano](https://volcano.sh/en/) as our gang scheduler for multi-node jobs, which doesn't
        work well with autoscalers.</Note>

        <Tip>
            If you need help with the steps below, reach out to someone on the Platform
            team in your organization or let us know and we'll be happy to work with you
            to get this set up!
        </Tip>

        Follow these steps to get your Kubernetes cluster ready for Komodo:

        

        <Accordion title="Install Volcano" icon="volcano">
            Komodo uses [Volcano](https://volcano.sh/en/) to schedule workloads on your Kubernetes cluster.

            Install Volcano by following the appropriate instructions in the [Volcano README](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano#readme).
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title="Create Komodo Resources" icon="dragon">
            Komodo uses isolated resources to schedule workloads on your cluster. In this section we will configure these resources.

            **Create Komodo Cluster Role**

            ```bash
            kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/komodoai/komo_cli/main/komodo_cli/terraform/komodo_manifests/files/cluster-role.yaml
            ```

            **Create Komodo Service Account**

            ```bash
            kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/komodoai/komo_cli/main/komodo_cli/terraform/komodo_manifests/files/service-account.yaml
            ```

            **Link the Komodo Service Account to the Komodo Cluster Role**

            ```bash
            kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/komodoai/komo_cli/main/komodo_cli/terraform/komodo_manifests/files/cluster-role-binding.yaml
            ```

            **Create a Komodo Service Account Token**

            ```bash
            kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/komodoai/komo_cli/main/komodo_cli/terraform/komodo_manifests/files/service-account-token.yaml
            ```
        </Accordion>
        <Accordion title="Obtain and store cluster details" icon="gear">
            To prepare for the next step, you'll need to obtain the URL of your Kubernetes cluster API server and a token to communicate with the cluster.

            <Note>
            This token belongs to the Service Account we created in the Kubernetes cluster
            configuration step.
            </Note>

            First set the `CLUSTER_NAME` environment variable to the name of your cluster.

            <Accordion title="How to get cluster name?">
            Try `kubectl config view | grep -m 1 "name" | awk '{ print $2 }'` command or ask your platform engineer.
            </Accordion>

            ```bash
            export CLUSTER_NAME="my-cluster-name"
            ```

            ##### **host**

            The value for `host` can be obtained in the following way

            ```bash
            kubectl cluster-info $CLUSTER_NAME | grep "control plane" | awk '{ print $NF }'
            ```

            ##### **bearer_token**

            The value for the `bearer_token` can be obtained using the following steps.

            ```bash
            echo "Obtaining the Service Account token for cluster $CLUSTER_NAME"
            echo ""
            TOKEN=$(kubectl get secret komodo-runner-secret --namespace default -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 -d)
            echo "$TOKEN"
            ```
        </Accordion>
        <Accordion title="Create the backend">
          Simply just run:

          ```bash
          komo backend create -t kubernetes -n my-cluster
          ```

          This will prompt you to enter some of the information that you gathered above.
        </Accordion>
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize a Komodo project in your repository">
    Initialize a new Komodo project by running the following command inside your project directory:
    
    ```bash
    komo init project
    ```
    
    This will create a template project configuration in  `.komo/project.yaml`. This will set up
    different configurations for the different backends you created earlier.
    Edit this file to fit your needs.

    <Tip>You should be able to use this without any changes, as long as you have a requirements.txt file in your
    project directory that has all the requirements needed to run your code.</Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Your First Komodo Job">
    You are now ready to run your first job! 
    
    ```bash
    komo run -b aws -r p4-24xl echo "Hello World!"
    ```

Komodo AI can run your jobs on various backends. The choice of backend is yours - we strive to provide the same seamless experience regardless of your choice.

## Install Komodo CLI

Install Komodo CLI from PyPI. If you're not able to use PyPI to install your packages, let us know and we will be happy to provide you with a Python Wheel file.

```bash
pip install komodo-cli
```

## Choose and configure backend

**Supported Backends**

- Local
- Kubernetes

If you want us to support a new backend, let us know by opening a GitHub issue.

### Configuration

#### Local

The Local backend requires no configuration, the sample below can be used as is. However, please make sure you have Docker [installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and running.

#### Kubernetes

A few steps are required to prepare your Kubernetes cluster for use with Komodo if the cluster was not created using `komo compute create`.

<Tip>
  If you need help with the steps below, reach out to someone on the Platform
  team in your organization or let us know and we'll be happy to work with you
  to get this set up!
</Tip>

<Accordion title="Install Volcano" icon="volcano">
Komodo uses [Volcano](https://volcano.sh/en/) to schedule workloads on your Kubernetes cluster.

Install Volcano by following the appropriate instructions in the [Volcano README](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano#readme).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Create Komodo Resources" icon="dragon">
Komodo uses isolated resources to schedule workloads on your cluster. In this section we will configure these resources.

**Create Komodo Cluster Role**

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/komodoai/komo_cli/main/komodo_cli/terraform/komodo_manifests/files/cluster-role.yaml
```

**Create Komodo Service Account**

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/komodoai/komo_cli/main/komodo_cli/terraform/komodo_manifests/files/service-account.yaml
```

**Link the Komodo Service Account to the Komodo Cluster Role**

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/komodoai/komo_cli/main/komodo_cli/terraform/komodo_manifests/files/cluster-role-binding.yaml
```

**Create a Komodo Service Account Token**

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/komodoai/komo_cli/main/komodo_cli/terraform/komodo_manifests/files/service-account-token.yaml
```

</Accordion>

## Setup Your Machine for Komodo

Now that you've chosen and configured your backend(s), you're ready to configure your machine with with a global Komodo configuration file. This file stores your Komodo credentials as well as information on the backends that will run your jobs.

The global configuration file is expected at `~/.komo/config.yaml`. Below we provide a sample and go over how to populate it.

```yaml
komodo_api_key: ABC1234
backends:
  local:
    type: local
    config: {}
  k8s:
    type: kubernetes
    config:
      host: https://my-k8s-host.com
      bearer_token: KLMNO1234
```

### Komodo API Key

The Komodo API key is used to authenticate to the Komodo API. Obtain an API key by providing your login credentials via the `komo get-api-key` command and its value to the `komodo_api_key` field in the configuration file. [Find more details on this command here.](./komo-cli-reference/command/get-api-key)

### Backends

You can configure various backend under the `backends` key which contains a dictionary, mapping backend name to the backend config.

Each backend specification must include a type and a backend-specific config.

#### Local

The Local backend requires no configuration, the sample above can be used as is. However, please make sure you have Docker [installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and running.

#### Kubernetes

Once you're done [configuring your Kubernetes cluster for use with Komodo](/getting-started#kubernetes), you'll need to obtain the URL of your Kubernetes cluster API server and a token to communicate with the cluster.

<Note>
  This token belongs to the Service Account we created in the Kubernetes cluster
  configuration step.
</Note>

First set the `CLUSTER_NAME` environment variable to the name of your cluster.

```bash
export CLUSTER_NAME="my-cluster-name"
```

##### **host**

The value for `host` can be obtained in the following way

```bash
kubectl cluster-info $CLUSTER_NAME | grep "control plane" | awk '{ print $NF }'
```

##### **bearer_token**

The value for the `bearer_token` can be obtained using the following steps.

<Accordion title="How to get cluster name?">
Try `kubectl config view | grep -m 1 "name" | awk '{ print $2 }'` command or ask your platform engineer.
</Accordion>

```bash
echo "Obtaining the Service Account token for cluster $CLUSTER_NAME"
echo ""
TOKEN=$(kubectl get secret komodo-runner-secret --namespace default -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 -d)
echo "$TOKEN"
```

## Initialize a Komodo Project

Before you can run Komodo jobs, you need to initialize a new Komodo project in your repository. Run `komo init` wherever you'd like to do that. This will create a `.komo` directory with a template project configuration in the `project.yaml` file. Edit this file to fit your needs.

You can find more information on `komo init` and the project configuration file [here](./komo-cli-reference/command/init).

## Run Your First Komodo Job

TODO: Should maybe do this on the demo repository?

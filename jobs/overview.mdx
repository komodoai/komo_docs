Komodo jobs allow you to easily deploy your data processing/training/inferencing jobs onto self-terminating instances.

## Key Features

- **Custom, Reproducable Environments**: Define your own custom environment with all the dependencies you need in a simple YAML file
- **Serverless Execution**: Your jobs run in serverless style - when your job finishes, the instance is automatically terminated so that you only pay for the compute you use. Never worry about forgetting to run off instances ever again.
- **Multi-Node Distributed Jobs**: Launch distributed jobs across multiple nodes by simply adding the `num_nodes` parameter to your job config.
- **Automatic Git Access**: Simply add the public SSH key from the [settings page](https://app.komodo.io/settings) to your Github/Gitlab account, and all your jobs will have access to pull your private repos
- **Best GPU Availability/Pricing**: Connect one or multiple cloud accounts and instantly get access to maximum GPU availability at the lowest prices. When you launch a job, Komodo will search all your cloud accounts for the cheapest available instances that meet your resource requirements.

Create an account, connect your cloud account, and start running your workflows in minutes.

### 1. Create an account and connect your cloud

Before you get started, make sure to create an account and connect your cloud account(s).

1. [Sign up](https://app.komodoai.dev) for a free account at [app.komodoai.dev](https://app.komodoai.dev) and log in.
2. Connect a cloud provider on the [Settings](https://app.komodoai.dev/settings) page.

### 2. Install Komodo CLI and authenticate

Install the CLI:

```bash
pip install komo
```

Head to the [Settings](https://app.komodoai.dev/settings) page and copy your API key.

Now login and provide your API key when prompted:

```bash
komo login
```

### 3. Hello World!

Let's define our very first job, a simple Hello World! program.

Copy the following YAML into a `hello.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Replace this with the cloud that you connected earlier
cloud: aws

resources:
  # 1x A10G GPU
  accelerators: A10G:1

env:
  # set the environment variable MY_ENV_VAR to my-value
  MY_ENV_VAR: my-value

# Copy the contents of the current directory onto the remote machine
workdir: .

# Typical use: pip install -r requirements.txt
# Invoked under the workdir (ie. can use its files)
setup: |
  echo "Running setup operations"

# Typical use: run your actual job - eg. python train.py
# Invoked under the workdir (ie. can use its files)
run: |
  echo "Hello World!"
```

This defines a job that does the following:

- Launches an AWS instance with 1 A10G GPU
- Sets an environment variable
- Copies the current directory to the remote instance
- Executes the setup operations inside the remote workdir
- Executes the run operations inside the remote workdir

To launch this job, simply run:

```bash
komo job launch hello.yaml
```

And that's it! The logs from the job will be streamed by the CLI in real-time, and you can also access them from the [web dashboard](https://app.komodoai.dev). Once the job finishes, the remote instance will be terminated.

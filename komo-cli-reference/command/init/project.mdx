## init project
The `init project` command is used to initialize a new Komodo project in the current directory. This command creates a new Komodo configuration file and sets up your project to use Komodo's services. To initialize a new project, run the following command:

```
komo init project
```

This will create a template project configuration in  `.komo/project.yaml`. This will set up
different configurations for the different backends you created earlier.

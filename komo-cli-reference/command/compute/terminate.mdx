### compute terminate

The `compute terminate` command is used to terminate a compute cluster. To terminate a machine, you need to specify the machine name as an argument. For example, to terminate a machine `machine123`, you can use the following command:

```
komo compute terminate [OPTIONS]
```

```
-b, --backend: Type of the compute cluster type to destroy.
```

```
-c, --cluster-id: ID of the cluster to destroy.
```

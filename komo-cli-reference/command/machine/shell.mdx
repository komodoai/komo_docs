### machine shell
The `machine shell` command is used to open a shell into a running Komodo machine. This allows you to interact with the job's environment and execute commands inside it. To open a shell, you need to specify the machine name as an argument. For example, to open a shell into machine `machine123`, you can use the following command:

```
komo machine shell machine1234
```

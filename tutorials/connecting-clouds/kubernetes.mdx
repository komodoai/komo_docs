This guide will walk you through the process of getting your Kubernetes cluster ready to be used on Komodo.

## Supported Kubernetes deployments

* Managed Kubernetes services (Amazon - EKS, Google Cloud - GKE)
* On-prem clusters (Kubeadm, Rancher, RKE, K3s)

</Tip>

## Prerequisites

* A Kubernetes cluster with a publicly-accessible control plane endpoint
* Each cluster node assigned a public (external) IP
* Each cluster node labeled with the GPU type.

<Tip>
If your cluster has the NVIDIA GPU Operator installed or you are using GKE or Karpenter, your nodes already have the necessary GPU labels. No further action is required.
</Tip>

Currently supported GPU labels:
* `nvidia.com/gpu.product`: automatically created by the Nvidia GPU operator
* `cloud.google.com/gke-accelerator`: used by GKE clusters
* `karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-gpu-name`: used by Karpenter

To check if your cluster is compatible, run:
```bash
echo "Checking nodes for external IP addresses..."
nodes=$(kubectl get nodes -o=jsonpath="{.items[*]['status.addresses', 'metadata.annotations']}" | tr -d " \t\n\r")
FOUND_EXTERNAL_IP_FROM_STATUS=false
FOUND_EXTERNAL_IP_FROM_ANNOTATION=false
if [[ $nodes == *"ExternalIP"* ]]; then
  FOUND_EXTERNAL_IP_FROM_STATUS=true
fi
if [[ $nodes == *"rke.cattle.io/external-ip"* ]]; then
  FOUND_EXTERNAL_IP_FROM_ANNOTATION=true
fi
FOUND_EXTERNAL_IPS=""
if [ "$FOUND_EXTERNAL_IP_FROM_STATUS" = true ] || [ "$FOUND_EXTERNAL_IP_FROM_ANNOTATION" = true ]; then
  FOUND_EXTERNAL_IPS="FOUND"
fi
echo "Checking nodes for GPU labels..."
output=$(kubectl get nodes --show-labels | awk -F'[, ]' '{for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) if ($i ~ /nvidia.com\/gpu.product=|cloud.google.com\/gke-accelerator=|karpenter.k8s.aws\/instance-gpu-name=/) print $i}')
if [ -z "$output" ]; then
  echo "No valid GPU labels found."
else
  echo "GPU Labels found:"
  echo "$output"
fi
if [ -n "$FOUND_EXTERNAL_IPS" ] && [ -n "$output" ]; then
  echo "Your cluster is ready for GPU workloads with Komodo AI"
else
  echo "Your cluster is not ready for GPU workloads with Komodo AI."
  echo "Contact us at hello@komodoai.dev or join our Discord server at https://discord.gg/baJGK6RKZC for help."
fi
```

<Tip>
Instructions for setting up NVIDIA GPU Operator on your cluster can be found [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/getting-started.html#install-nvidia-gpu-operator)

## Step 1: Create the Komodo Service Account

To create a service account that  Komodo will use to launch your workloads on Kubernetes run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/komodoai/komo_docs/main/files/komodo.yaml
```

This will create resources in the `default` namespace. If you'd like to run your workloads in another namespace, 
download the YAML file above and change the namespace on every line with the comment `Change to your namespace if using a different one`

Copy this YAML to a file called `service-account.yaml` and then run:

## Step 2: Get the values to connect cluster to Komodo

Run the below script to get the cluster control plane endpoint, Komodo service account token, and optionally, the cluster certificate authority data.

```bash
CLUSTER_CONTROL_PLANE_ENDPOINT=$(kubectl cluster-info  `kubectl config view | grep -m 1 "name" | awk '{ print $2 }'` | grep "control plane" | awk '{ print $NF }')
KOMODO_SA_SECRET=$(kubectl get secret komodo-secret --namespace default -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 -d)
CLUSTER_CA_DATA=$(kubectl config view --raw --minify --flatten -o jsonpath='{.clusters[0].cluster.certificate-authority-data}' 2>/dev/null)
if [ -z "$CLUSTER_CA_DATA" ]; then
  CLUSTER_CA_DATA="No Cluster Certificate Authority data found"
fi

echo "Cluster Control Plane endpoint:"
echo $CLUSTER_CONTROL_PLANE_ENDPOINT
echo "\n"
echo "Komodo Service Account Secret:"
echo $KOMODO_SA_SECRET
echo "\n"
echo "Cluster Certificate Authority data:"
echo $CLUSTER_CA_DATA
```

<Tip>
If no cluster certificate authority data was found, ask your IT administrator to obtain this data.

This is optional but highly recommended so that Komodo can verify your control plane's TLS certificate.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Connect your Kubernetes cluster to Komodo

Now that you have your control plane endpoint, service account token, and (optionally) your certificate authority data you're ready to connect it to Komodo.

In the Komodo console, navigate to the [Settings](https://app.komodoai.dev/settings) page, click `Connect` in the Kubernetes section and paste the values from Step 2 into the respective fields.


And that's it! You can now launch your workflows on Komodo! Follow [this tutorial](../../quickstart) to get started.

## FAQ

<Accordion title="What is a Service Account in Kubernetes?">
A Service Account in Kubernetes is an identity used by processes running within the cluster. It provides a way for pods to communicate securely with the Kubernetes API. Service accounts are used to manage permissions and control what actions can be performed by the processes within the cluster. In this guide, the Komodo service account is created to allow Komodo AI to interact with your Kubernetes cluster and launch workloads on your behalf.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why Use Cluster Certificate Authority Data?">
The Cluster Certificate Authority (CA) data is used to verify the identity of the Kubernetes control plane. This ensures that communication between Komodo AI and your Kubernetes cluster is secure and trusted. By providing the CA data, you enable Komodo to verify the TLS certificate presented by the control plane, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks and ensuring a secure connection. While optional, it is highly recommended to include this information to enhance the security of your cluster's integration with Komodo AI.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What Are the Supported GPU Labels and Why Are They Important?">
Supported GPU labels are specific labels applied to your Kubernetes nodes to identify the type of GPU available. These labels are essential for Komodo AI to recognize and utilize the appropriate GPU resources for your workloads.

By ensuring your nodes have the correct GPU labels, you enable Komodo AI to effectively allocate GPU resources for your AI and machine learning tasks, optimizing performance and efficiency.

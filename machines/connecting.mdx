title: Connecting to Machines
---

After you have launched a machine, you can connect to them through a Jupyter notebook, VSCode, or SSH.

<Tip>To see the machines you have running from the CLI, just run `komo machine list`</Tip>

## Connecting through Jupyter Notebooks

If you launched a machine with a notebook, you can open it by simply finding your machine on the dashboard and clicking on the 'Open Notebook' button.
Alternatively, you can open it with the CLI:

```bash
komo machine notebook <machine-name>
```

## Connecting through VSCode

<Note>This requires that you install the [VSCode CLI](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/command-line)</Note>

You can also open a machine inside VSCode:

```bash
komo machine vscode <machine-name>
```

## Connecting over SSH

To connect to a machine over SSH, simply run:

```bash
komo machine ssh <machine-name>
```

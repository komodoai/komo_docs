title: GPU-Backed Notebooks
---

Launching GPU-backed notebooks is a breeze with Komodo:

### 1. Create your machine config file

Copy the following YAML file to `dev.yaml` and modify it to your needs:

```yaml
resources:
  # 1x A10/A10G GPU
  accelerators: {A10G:1, A10:1}

env:
  # set the environment variable MY_ENV_VAR to my-value
  MY_ENV_VAR: my-value

# Copy the contents of the current directory onto the remote machine
workdir: .

# Typical use: pip install -r requirements.txt
# Invoked under the workdir (ie. can use its files)
setup: |
  echo "Running setup operations"

# Start a notebook on the machine
notebook: true
```

### 2. Launch the machine

Launch the machine by simply running:

<Note>Machine names are required to be unique, because that is how you reference them with the CLI.</Note>

```bash
komo machine launch dev.yaml --name dev
```

You can also omit the `notebook` parameter in the config file, and instead
start a notebook with the `--notebook` CLI flag:

```bash
komo machine launch dev.yaml --notebook --name dev
```

<Note>When interacting with machines using the CLI, you reference them using their **unique name** rather than their ID.</Note>

And that's it! Once your machine is running, you will be able to open the notebook from the dashboard.
You can also open the notebook from the CLI:

```bash
komo machine notebook dev
```

Komodo machines allow you to easily launch GPU-backed instances where you can do your development.

### Key Features

- **Custom, Reproducable Environments**: Define your own custom environment with all the dependencies you need in a simple YAML file
- **GPU-backed Notebooks**: Launch machines with Jupyter notebooks already running, and open them right from the dashboard
- **VScode**: Easily open machines in VSCode with a single [CLI command](../reference/komo-cli-reference/command/machine/vscode)
- **Automatic Git Access**: Simply add the public SSH key from the [settings page](https://app.komodoai.dev/settings) to your Github/Gitlab account, and all your machines will have access to pull your private repos
- **Best GPU Availability/Pricing**: Connect one or multiple cloud accounts and instantly get access to maximum GPU availability at the lowest prices. When you launch a machine, Komodo will search all your cloud accounts for the cheapest available instances that meet your resource requirements.

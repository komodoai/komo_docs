title: Using Docker Containers
---

## Overview

You can use docker containers in one of two ways:

* As a runtime environment - your setup and run commands will be executed inside the container
* As a task - run `docker run` inside your setup/run commands

## Docker Containers as a Runtime Environment

To use a docker container as a runtime environment, update your task yaml as follows:

```yaml
resources:
    accelerators: A100:1
    image_id: docker:<image_id> # eg. docker:nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:23.10-py3

setup: |
    # this will get run inside the container

run: |
    # this will get run inside the container
```

## Docker Containers as a Task

Alternatively, you can run a docker image right inside your setup/run commands:

```yaml
resources:
    accelerators: A100:1

run: |
    docker run --gpus all --shm-size 1g -v ~/data:/data \
    ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference \
    --model-id lmsys/vicuna-13b-v1.5
```

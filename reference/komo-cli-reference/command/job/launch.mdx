### Examples

Run the hello world job described in the [quickstart](../../../../quickstart)

```bash
komo job launch hello-world.yaml
```

Run the same job, but this time specify a different command to run

```bash
komo job launch hello-world.yaml --run 'echo goodbye world'
```

Run a training job distributed over 4 nodes.
Your job will have access to the following environment variables:

`SKYPILOT_NODE_RANK`: rank (an integer ID from 0 to num_nodes-1) of the node executing the task

`SKYPILOT_NODE_IPS`: a string of IP addresses of the nodes reserved to execute the task, where each line contains one IP address

`SKYPILOT_NUM_GPUS_PER_NODE`: number of GPUs reserved on each node to execute the task; the same as the count in accelerators: \<name\>:\<count\> 

```bash
komo job launch my-training-job.yaml --num-nodes 4
```

Run a job and exit as soon as the job has started

```bash
komo job launch hello-world.yaml -d
```

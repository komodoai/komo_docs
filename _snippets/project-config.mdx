<Note>Each key in the `backends` section in the project config must correspond to the name of a backend you previously created.</Note>

```yaml
# When a workspace is defined for a backend, a new docker image is created
# by taking your base image copying in the workspace into the image. As a result,
# this image needs to be uploaded somewhere for the backend to download it from.
# This repository is where the images will be uploaded. Please make sure that your
# backend is set up with the correct permissions to download images from this repository.

    base_image: "python:3.8"

    workdir: "/app"
    # This is the directory that will be copied into your docker image before running it.
    # This isn't needed for the local backend, because you can mount in any directory you
    # want, instead of copying it into the docker image.
    workspace: null
    # TODO: You can set any number of environment variables here.
    env:

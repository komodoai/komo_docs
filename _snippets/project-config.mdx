<Note>The `backends` configuration in the project config must map to the `backends` configured via `komo backend create`.</Note>

```yaml
# When a workspace is defined for a backend, a new docker image is created
# by taking your base image copying in the workspace into the image. As a result,
# this image needs to be uploaded somewhere for the backend to download it from.
# This repository is where the images will be uploaded. Please make sure that your
# backend is set up with the correct permissions to download images from this repository.

    base_image: "python:3.8"
    # TODO: set this to the directory inside your image where your command will run
    workdir: "/app"
    # This is the directory that will be copied into your docker image before running it.
    # This isn't needed for the local backend, because you can mount in any directory you
    # want, instead of copying it into the docker image.
    workspace: null
    # TODO: You can set any number of environment variables here.
    env:
      test_var: "test_value"
    # This is where you can specify the directories you want to mount into your container.
    mounts:
      # Mount in the current directory into /app
      - source: .
        target: /app

    # TODO: set this to the docker image that you want to use locally
    base_image: "python:3.9"
    # TODO: set this to the directory inside your image where your command will run
    workdir: "/app"
    # This is the directory that will be copied into your docker image before running it.
    # Specifying '.' as shown below will use the current project directory.
    # This means that every time you run a job, all of the files you have in your project directory
    # (doesn't matter if they're committed with git or not) will be copied into your docker image
    # before starting the job.
    workspace: null
    # TODO: You can set any number of environment variables here.
    env:
      test_var: "test_value"
    # This is where you can specify the directories you want to mount into your container.
    # These are NOT local directories, but rather directories that would exist in the node
    # on your kubernetes cluster (eg. a shared file system)

    # These specify the types of resources you'd want to use to run your jobs.
    # Different types of jobs might use different resources. For example, you might need 4 gpus
    # for a training job, but only 1 gpu for an evaluation job.
    # Here is where you can specify these different types of resources.
    # This resources section is a mapping from <resource name> (which is defined by you, the user) to
    # the set of resources needed to be specified for the backend. For Kubernetes, you need to specify
    # the number of gpus, cpus, and memory (in MB).
    # Below, you can see there are 3 resources already defined for you. One is named 'gpu1', and requires
    # 1 gpu, 8 cpus, and 8gb of memory.
    # The name that you provide for each resource is the same name you will use for the --resource flag in
    # the CLI.
    # TODO: Update these to specify the resources you need for your project.

      gpu1: # change this name to whatever you want

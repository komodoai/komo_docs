Komodo services all you to easily serve models that scale up and down with traffic. Just define your service, and we'll take care of the autoscaling and load balancing.

## Key Features

- **Custom, Reproducable Environments**: Define your own custom environment with all the dependencies you need in a simple YAML file
- **Autoscaling**: Komodo will scale up and down replicas for your service based on traffic, so that your models are production-ready at any scale.
- **Scale-To-Zero**: Enable serverless-style model serving with scale-to-zero capabilities. When your model has no traffic, we'll scale your replicas down to zero so that you're not paying for idle compute.
- **Automatic Git Access**: Simply add the public SSH key from the [settings page](https://app.komodo.io/settings) to your Github/Gitlab account, and all your services will have access to pull your private repos
- **Multi-Cloud Scaling**: When Komodo scales up your replicas, it will provision replicas in any of the cloud accounts you have connected, ensure maximum GPU availability at the lowest prices.
